          <h2 className="heading">hi!</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Nabiha Rauf, I am 24 years old and I am a self-taught
            painter. I am on a learning journey teaching myself painting
            techniques and ways of expression. I picked up on painting a few
            years back when I was looking for ways to deal with anxiety. Iâ€™m an
            introvert and always express myself through my paintings; my art is
            the reflection of my soul. My inspirations are very random. It could
            be anything, an image I might have seen, patterns on a piece of
            cloth, an emotion I felt while watching a movie or reading a line
            from a book. I have a vivid imagination and that has played a vital
            part in what I create. In my creations I try to portray a little
            part of the universe through my eyes. My main focus is to use my
            paintings to directly draw out the emotions and experiences of the
            viewer.
