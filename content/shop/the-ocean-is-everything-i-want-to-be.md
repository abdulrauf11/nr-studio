description: >-
  Original mixed media painting on canvas. Inspired by the movement and
  immensity of the sea. The sea is where my body feels alive,  my mind feels
  free and my spirit feels restored. The world seems to stand still as I paint 
  the sea and all my worries washaway as I pour out my heart and soul into each
  piece.
