  I’ve always been fascinated by the immensity and depth of the sea. It’s
  beautiful yet so intimidating. It is free, you cannot control it. And this is
  what we all want in our life, to be free, free from all kind of fear. Only
  when we are free we can reach our full potential. 
   I don’t try to mimic reality in my paintings; I only express my raw emotions. For me, the smell of the sea, sound of the crashing waves and the depth of the sea is freeing and refreshing. I use texture in my paintings to evolve a sense of raw emotion. Dimensions and depths are produced by the formation of multiple layers. The use of heavy texture helps me to create a strong composition.
