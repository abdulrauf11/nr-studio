  My interest in flowers is not in replicating the subject itself. But rather I
  find the texture, shape, color and radiance of the flowers fascinating. Each
  painting is created to evoke a sense of raw emotion through the element of
  texture. All that we see and interact with throughout our life can be
  translated to an exciting form of texture. Textured elements of the natural
  world inspire my art; the rough texture on tree bark, rocks in the middle of
  the sea, damaged brick walls. It is the element of texture that allows the
  viewer to make a connection with my work. 

  Dimensions and depth are produced by using thick paint directly from the tube.
  I apply intentional and unintentional brush strokes to make the painting look
  completely random. My paintings are not pre planned. They are spontaneous,
  done without giving them much thought. Spontaneity is a key process in my
  work.
